  "aboutMeText": "Hi! My name is Hans Marius, but online I'm known as Spookyrumble. I am a passionate and dedicated person who highly values both technology and human relationships.\n\nOne of my biggest interests is cars, motorcycles, and Formula 1. I love the excitement and technology behind motorsports, and I spend a lot of time staying updated on everything happening in this fascinating world.\n\nFor me, politeness and respect for others are very important. I believe that one should always be careful about assuming what others have been through. This makes me an objective and understanding person who always tries to see things from others' perspectives. I believe that most people are good and that everyone deserves respect.\n\nAlthough I am a rather private person, I am very open with my inner circle of friends and family. My children are a great inspiration to me. I learn a lot by observing how they approach the world with curiosity and openness. Their unreserved view of life motivates me to always strive to be a better version of myself.\n\nFriends would describe me as curious, motivated, and always ready to help. I believe in continuous learning and strive to improve myself every day, whether it is mastering a new programming language or exploring a new hobby. I am driven by a desire to innovate and make a positive impact through technology.",
